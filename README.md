# wave-analysis

As part of my research internship at INRIA in the COSMIQ team, under the supervision of N. Sendrier and T. Debris-Alazard, I realized a tool allowing the analysis of Wave implementations to detect potential unintentional errors. 

In this repo you will find different implementations of Wave (including the reference one) with potential errors and a uniformly distributed random w-weight word generator. The analysis tool uses the code of the reference implementation, notably for the management of the ternary bitsliced arithmetic and for the management of the private key. 

The manual is in this repo in pdf and includes in appendix the theoretical support of the realized tests.
